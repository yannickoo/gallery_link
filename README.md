You can display images as gallery triggered by a link.

# Installation

2. Unzip the archive and put the fancybox folder inside into sites/all/libraries
   (so jquery.fancybox.pack.js is located at
   sites/all/libraries/fancybox/source/jquery.fancybox.pack.js)

3. Add an image field to a entity type and select "Gallery Link" as
   field formatter at the "Manage display" page.

4. Set some options and save them.
